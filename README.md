# Introduction

For the test we are going to ask you to do a couple of smaller JS exercises. The exercises will be very similar (but a little harder) to what you have done in the homework.

# Goal / Requirements
Go through all of the `question-x.js` files. At the top of the file there is an explanation of what you need to do. Read through that carefully and write the javascript needed to solve the problem.

Once you have completed all of the questions (or it is time to hand in), create a new project in your github and upload the files there. Then send the link to that github project to @Rob van Kruijsdijk on slack.

# Grading
Every question has a certain amount of points associated with that question. Spend your time wisely, if you get stuck on a question, move on to the next one. 

- Question 1 [up to 4 points]
- Question 2 [up to 2 points]
- Question 3 [up to 4 points]
- Question 4 [up to 3 points]
- Question 5 [up to 3 points]
- Code is nicely organised and clean [up to 4 points]
  - No more `console.log` test lines
  - No commented out code
  - Comments for functions/lines of code that can be unclear for other programmers or yourself in 5 months
  - Are the variables/functions named nicely
  - Check that the code is split logically (no repeated code in multiple functions, functions that are used for the same step close together in a file or in a separate file)

Make sure you spend the time to clean up your code as we will grade on that too!
